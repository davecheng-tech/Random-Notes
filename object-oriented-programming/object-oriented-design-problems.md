# Object-Oriented Design Challenges

### Overview

In this challenge, you’ll be presented with four real-world design scenarios. Your task is to design an object-oriented system for each situation. This means identifying and creating the right classes, deciding what data belongs in each class, and figuring out how the classes relate to each other. You’re not expected to write code — just focus on designing a good system using OOP principles.

### Four Principles of OOP
#### Abstraction
Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object through a clear and simple interface.

#### Encapsulation
Bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some components to protect the integrity of the object.

#### Inheritance
Allowing one class (subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another (superclass), promoting code reuse and hierarchical classification.

#### Polymorphism
Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, allowing the same method to behave differently depending on the object’s runtime type.

## Design Problem 1: Fitness Tracker App

A company wants to build a fitness tracking app. Users log physical activities like walking, running, and cycling. Each activity records the duration, distance, and calories burned. Users can also set weekly goals (e.g., run 15 km per week) and check their progress.

Your task:
- What classes are needed?
- What properties and behaviors should each class have?
- How would you handle different types of activities?
- Where should the logic for calculating progress or calories go?

## Design Problem 2: Online Ordering System

A restaurant needs a system to process online food orders. Each customer can select multiple menu items (like burgers, fries, and drinks). The system must total the price, apply tax, and handle discounts or promotions.

Your task:
- What classes would you create?
- How would you model different menu items?
- Where should the tax and discount logic live?
- How would you ensure an order calculates its total correctly?

## Design Problem 3: Animal Shelter

An animal shelter wants a digital system to keep track of animals in their care. Animals can be different types — some can be walked (e.g. dogs), others need cages (e.g. birds). They also have medical records and adoption status.

Your task:
- What would your class hierarchy for animals look like?
- How would you store medical records?
- What makes a good use of inheritance here?
- What methods would each class need?

## Design Problem 4: Music Streaming Queue

A music streaming service needs a system to manage user playlists. A playlist can contain multiple songs. Some playlists are manually created by the user, while others are “smart” playlists based on filters like genre or mood. Songs have a title, artist, duration, and genre.

Your task:
- What classes do you need?
- What’s the relationship between playlists and songs?
- How might a smart playlist work differently from a manual one?
- How would you handle play order or repeat behavior?

## What to Submit

Sketch or describe your class diagrams for each problem. Use boxes for classes, and lines/arrows to show relationships. Include method and property names where possible.

You’ll have time to work on this independently or in pairs. Then we’ll take up each example together: looking first at a beginner solution and then at a more polished, professional version.
